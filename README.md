**Project overview**

The Georgetown Outbreak Activity Library (GOAL) was developed to provide a global resource to describe what needs to be done, when, and by whom, throughout all phases of outbreak preparedness, response, and recovery. Here, we provide rapid access to a comprehensive library of activities with relevant international and national policies and regulations, access to key information about stakeholders, and examples through a series of case studies. The tool is designed to support responders in understanding what needs to get done, by whom, and when in the context of an event, providing information on existing guidance and authorities and to define response requirements for new and emerging events. GOAL can also be used for preparedness and planning efforts to ensure that this work is comprehensive and based in the practical realities of outbreak response.

GOAL is regularly updated to expand and refine the activity descriptions, update policies and plans relevant to each activity, and add to the library of case studies.

The tool was developed by the Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security. The content draws from feedback from panels of international experts on outbreak preparedness and response in addition to on-going research efforts within the Center.
